## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Reporting Portfolio

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets across different domainsâ€”administrative, survey-based, and geospatial. It includes practical examples of:

- Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis
- Handling missing, inconsistent, and unstructured data
- Producing summary statistics and visual reports
- Mapping and enriching geospatial information

Each notebook simulates a data workflow that a Junior Data Scientist or Analyst might perform in business, government, or research settings.

Tools used: Python (pandas, matplotlib, geopandas), Jupyter Notebook, Excel, GeoJSON, Folium.
